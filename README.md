REAL-TIME RIVER WATER QUALITY MONITORING AND CONTROL SYSTEM!

TECHNOLOGY! : IOT

üìΩÔ∏è PROJECT DESCRIPTION :

The main aim of this project is to detect the quality of river water and quantity of pollutants present in water and so that river water quality is monitored and effective measures can be taken accordingly . To develop a system for real time quality assessment for river water health at residential places using Raspberry Pi. Sensors are used to gather different parameters in River water to monitor water health in real time. IoT is appeared to be a better solution as reliability, scalability, speed, and persistence can be provided

Problem Statement :

           Due to the fast growing urbanization supply of safe drinking water is a challenge for the every city authority. 
           Water can be polluted any time. So the water we reserved in the water tank at our roof top or basement in our society or apartment may not be safe. 
           Still in India most of the people use simple water purifier that is not enough to get surety of pure water.
           Sometimes the water has dangerous particles or chemical mixed and general purpose water purifier cannot purify that.
           And it‚Äôs impossible to check the quality of water manually in every time. So an automatic real-time monitoring system is required to monitor the health of the water reserved in our water tank of the society or apartment.
           So it can warn us automatically if there is any problem with the reserved water. 
           And we can check the quality of the water anytime and from anywhere.
Problem Solution :

Our goal is to develop a system for real time quality assessment for water health using Internet of things. pH, Turbidity and Temperature sensors are used to gather the parameters necessary to monitor water health in real time. Following are the objectives of the proposed system. To measure various chemical and physical properties of water like pH, temperature and particle density of water using sensors. Send the data collected and send it to IBM cloud based Database Send alert messages when any discrepancies are found in the water quality
